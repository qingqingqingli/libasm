# libasm

***The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language.***

## Technical considerations

- It is written in 64 bits ASM, compiled with [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/)

- It follows the Intel syntax

- It rewrites the following functions:
	- `ft_strlen`
	- `ft_strcpy`
	- `ft_strcmp`
	- `ft_write`
	- `ft_read`
	- `ft_strdup`

- Erroes during syscalls need to be checked and set properly
